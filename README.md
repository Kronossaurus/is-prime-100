# Is-Prime-100: A Revolutionary O(1) Algorithm for Prime Detection

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Is-Prime-100 the great successor of [Is-Prime](https://github.com/mawerty/Is-Prime), an innovative algorithm designed to determine whether a number is prime with 100% accuracy for integers(For technical reasons current inplementation supports only numbers from 1 to 5 milion, but it can be expaned!). This algorithm represents a groundbreaking approach to primality testing, harnessing advanced techniques and complex condition checks to achieve its results.
Overview

Prime numbers have long intrigued mathematicians and computer scientists alike. With Is-Prime-100, we introduce a novel method that operates in constant time (O(1)), delivering flawless results through intricate and sophisticated logic.
## Key Features

Unmatched Accuracy: Guarantees 100% accuracy.
Constant Time Complexity: Achieves rapid results by employing an advanced technique that circumvents traditional computational bottlenecks.
Sophisticated Logic: Utilizes a highly detailed set of conditions to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Performance

While this algorithm excels in accuracy, it is important to note that it is not the most optimized solution available. For those seeking the most efficient prime-checking algorithms, we recommend exploring [Is-Prime](https://github.com/mawerty/Is-Prime), which delivers approximately 95% accuracy with superior performance in real-life scenarios.
## NPM Package

Unfortunately this implementation isn't avaible as npm package, but you may be interested in checking out the [npm package of heuristic version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-prime-fast), which is almost as good as this one! 
## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance and extend this project. If you have ideas for optimizations, additional implementations in different languages, or improvements to the current approach, please submit a pull request or give the project a star to show your support.

## Guidelines

Function and Variable Naming: Adhere to naming conventions by using is_prime for functions and variables.
File Naming: The main file should be named main.extention.
New Language Implementations: If you see that implementation in any of the languages is suboptimal, or want to contribute to this great project, by rewriting it in new language, feel free to!

## FAQ

Q: Is this project serious?
A: Absolutely. This project is a serious exploration into innovative prime detection methodologies.

Q: How does the algorithm ensure 100% accuracy?
A: The algorithm employs a comprehensive set of conditions designed to verify primality with complete certainty for the specified range.

Q: What if I need a more performance-oriented solution?
A: For high-performance needs, consider the [Is-Prime heuristic implementation](https://github.com/mawerty/Is-Prime), which offers a high-performance alternative with approximately 95% accuracy.

Q: What if I need to check whether number is prime in my next-gen javascript project?
A: Unfortunately this implementation isn't avaible as npm package, but you may be interested in checking out the [npm package of heuristic version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-prime-fast), which is almost as good as this one!
